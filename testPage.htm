	 From <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/175389/None-Dare-Call-It-Treason#7468277">M-x shell</a> on the most current megathread: <em>"Request to admins to just have weekly or even daily resets of the megathread.

	Since this nightmare is never going to end and this issue isn't going to get better, I agree that the easiest way to facilitate this is to just have a rollover every week at the minimum. I like the link roundups but if they take someone a few hours to put together another thread every time, we can live without them, especially since the thread is already a catchall of all the daily drama and people post links to that as is. <br>
<br>
<small>(I apologize to M-x shell if they wanted to post this themselves, but I totally second the question and think we need to address it and if nobody else has posted it here as requested yet and I'm still diddling around the house this morning, what the hell.)</small>

<a name="1310775"></a><div class="comments">My own feeling about this is, I don't want automated thread rollover. I don't feel like new threads need to be encyclopedic link roundups, so there shouldn't be this anxiety about who "owns" an upcoming thread or that kind of thing. But I think it's good to have the natural gating effect that slows older threads down when there isn't a pressing new thing.<br>
<br>
When the thread gets over-long and creaky, it serves as a natural brake on the kind of chatty hangout type commenting that we're trying to decrease anyway. Whenever a new thread goes up there's a rush of fairly noisy comments -- which are fine, as always nobody's doing anything *wrong* but still, it's not ideal to kick it off with two or three dozen comments that are in effect "hi, I'm here, how are you guys? fuck these fuckers" and then repeating links from the previous thread. It revives the sense that those threads are just a forever chatroom, which is exactly what we *don't* want. So, on a day like today which is pretty quiet newswise so far (knock wood), it's fine for the thread to just be slow. There's not a big rush and if some news happens then someone will be moved to post.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/36820" target="_self">LobsterMitten</a> <a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/33/Who-is-in-charge-here-Are-there-admins-and-moderators-like-other-sites" class="staff" style="text-decoration:none;"><span class="staffp">(</span>staff<span class="staffp">)</span></a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310775" target="_self">3:55 PM</a> on July 28

I 100% get the reasoning here but imo in practice, intentionally letting threads degrade into unusability is exclusionary towards people who use mobile devices or not-so-new computers as their primary device for financial or accessibility reasons.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/38854" target="_self">lalex</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310777" target="_self">4:09 PM</a> on July 28

<br>
Daily resets seem like they would move things in a chattier direction, which moderators are on record as not wanting. And I like the recap of links--I think they make the posts more valuable as historical documents, and they help people who might not be as obsessed with the news cycle as I am. I don't think we need links to the next thread (because all these threads peter out with people commenting 'NEW THREAD NEW THREAD NEW THREAD), but a link to the previous one would be useful.<br>
<br>
I do agree that lowering the comment-count threshold where we start saying 'Hmm, is it time for a new post?' might be helpful.<br>

<a name="1310785"></a><div class="comments">One part of the current arrangement that I find valuable is the way that each new megathread is typically triggered by a new installment in the "can you believe these fucking fuckers" timeline - the old thread gets wooly, but a new one isn't really necessary until the most recent travesty is obviously going to provoke 500 new comments.<br>
<br>
For those of us who have to periodically duck out of the megathreads to preserve our sanity, that setup provides a pretty good balance between mental health and staying informed and makes it a lot easier to jump back in and get up to date relatively quickly. Meanwhile, the collection of all the actual-OP headers of all the megathreads forms a pretty important gloss of the history of the crisis, which feels like something worth preserving (as opposed to just having "Megathread XXLIV" with a link to that day's WTF Happened or whatever).<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/64511" target="_self">range</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310785" target="_self">6:23 PM</a> on July 28

<a name="1310804"></a><div class="comments">I too would be against the idea of automatic posting. MetaFilter is a human-centric site and I think it's important to hew closely to that principle. I'm fine with people manually making new politics posts more frequently though, if that is felt to be needed.<br>
<br>
I agree that the politics megathreads should be seen as an exception to how MetaFilter normally works rather than as a new normal, and that the site should be changed as little as possible to support them. Automatic posting seems like a big change to site norms, to me.<br>

If we want to fully support politics as a topic on MetaFilter, I think that the long-discussed creation of a PoliticsFilter subsite is the way to go. Give politics a home somewhere that's designed for it, rather than shoehorning in modifications to the Blue. I get why PoliticsFilter has never actually happened, though.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/204241" target="_self">Anticipation Of A New Lover's Arrival, The</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310804" target="_self">10:14 PM</a> on July 28

<a name="1310814"></a><div class="comments">I think there are two separate but related things happening:<br>
<br>
- When the thread gets extra long, some people have difficulty participating in it due to technical problems. A new thread solves this for them, and allows them to participate as usual. That's good.<br>
- When there's a new thread, people rush into it not just because their computers can handle it now, but because it's new, and that creates extra work for moderators. That's not so good.<br>
<br>
I feel like a solution, barring a technical fix like pagination, is to try to consistently create quick and dirty (even just single link) new threads before the existing ones top, say, 2,000 comments or whatever, but to apply some good human judgement as to the best timing to do that. Practically, that probably means letting a thread ride on over most weekends or during other slow times, but being better about creating new threads when things are busier. <br>

<br>
For me, it's that the expectation seemed to be that a "good" megathread post is sort of a recap of recent events. With so much going on it's kind of an overwhelming task that can be a timesuck, and in my experience there's very little engagement "reward", for lack of a better word.<br>
<br>
Mostly people aren't engaging with the specific articles posted because they generally know what's going on and/or the topics have already been introduced and are being discussed in the previous thread, since the megathreads are basically an up-to-the-minute continuum of What's Going On in American Politics.<br>
<br>
We also have a ton of astute, engaged posters and so it's pretty hard to find a great fresh take that hasn't already been linked. <br>
<br>
It's just really different from my typical experience on the blue when I post a cool thing that maybe people haven't seen or an interesting thing I think people might want to talk about. <br>
<br>
Back when I was a heavier participant in those threads I did start making posts that were just a roundup link and a couple other things, but it felt a bit like "cheating" and I wonder if that's holding other folks back.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/38854" target="_self">lalex</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310816" target="_self">12:48 AM</a> on July 29

I also second the issues with people's computers keeling over, the fact that it takes me hours (as a speed reader!) to make a big ol' post here when I do it (not often) and I think that's some barrier to rolling over for normal humans,  and that those are issues that have carried on for 2 years and the population of MeFi doesn't seem to be that great at timing when to do a rollover (plus it has to be whoever's at a regular computer, more than one might be doing it, etc).<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/37122" target="_self">jenfullmoon</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310847" target="_self">5:27 AM</a> on July 29

I wouldn't expect the mods to take on the Herculean task of creating a separate site.

Right now we're past 2300 comments in the current potus45 but there's also a lull in stupidity in the news because it's the weekend. You're not missing much except some meta and also the moderator team don't have to work as hard pruning off-topic discussion. Yeah we get some interesting tangential discussion happening but nothing up to the minute topical. <br>

I think these lulls and attrition of thread length are important because it lets moderators have some time off from the ridiculous amount of work they have to do on "the thread" and also you can slow down and discuss things that won't fly when Trump's latest flaming poop bag has the thread flying at a billion miles an hour.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/254260" target="_self">Definitely Not Sean Spicer</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310894" target="_self">3:09 PM</a> on July 29

<a name="1310896"></a><div class="comments">I'm in favor of keeping curated posts with links.  I think they are useful now, and are going to be historically important someday. It's such a good record of what what is the news at that particular time, and what people thought was important. I don't know how the Trump administration ends (impeachment, 25th amendment, election, coup, suspension of elections and imposition of a hereditary monarchy?). But whatever happens, I think this is an historically important time, and posts themselves (and relevant links--even if the articles suffer from link rot someday, the descriptions are still useful) as well as the discussion surrounding them are a really great window into the times.<br>

<a name="1310901"></a><div class="comments">No, no, no.  An automated FPP is exactly the opposite of MetaFilter—but it is exactly the sort of thing Facebook-Google-Twitter keep trying to promote.  It's the difference between creating a community out of people and trying to construct one out of algorithms.  (We can see how the latter doesn't work, but FGT's attempts to normalize it results in a lot of people outside the Blue coming around to the idea because That's Just How It's Done on the Web 2.0 Internet.)  And if FGT's engineers haven't been able to do this right, how on earth can we impose on MeFi's staff when they're already stretched thin over the politics mega-threads?<br>
<br>
Anyroad, I thought this MeTa was supposed to post on Monday, so I haven't drafted my thoughts.  Since this thread's well under way, I'm just going to follow up on what's already been said.<br>
<br>
<em>Whenever a new thread goes up there's a rush of fairly noisy comments</em><br>
<br>
Now imagine how badly this will go if there isn't some sort of FPP framing with selected news stories covering the important events since the previous one and the most recent developments breaking towards its end. <br>
<br>
<em>So, on a day like today which is pretty quiet newswise so far</em><br>
<br>
The news is <em>never</em> quiet except on the front pages of mainstream media and the cable news top-of-the-hour summaries.  What MeFites do so well in the politics mega-threads is dig deeper into current event beyond the first-take reporting and delve outside the news' conventional wisdom of what's going on.<br>
<br>
<em>At the very least it'd be nice to get some official approval of just making new threads be a link to someone else's roundup, like those at WTF Just Happened Today or What a Day.</em><br>
<br>
Except a lot of people won't click through to those links and RTFA.  This happens all the time with single-link FPPs, so imagine what it will be like with the US politics news.<br>
<br>
<em>"This post was deleted for the following reason: Alright, the people have spoken: they want a post with one or more external links as per usual. -- goodnewsfortheinsane"</em><br>
<br>
We've been down this road before.  Switching to an automated version will be worse.<br>
<br>
<em>One part of the current arrangement that I find valuable is the way that each new megathread is typically triggered by a new installment in the "can you believe these fucking fuckers" timeline</em><br>
<br>
That's just an illusion of the newsvortex's constant churning.  We could absolutely create a daily FPP on some angle on "can you believe these fucking fuckers" news.  The underlying problem is that the news genuinely is constantly bad.  Cable news' limited attention span can't process handle this, so it just runs a constantly updated chyron instead of contextualizing the Trump administration, and newspapers are still adjusting to the demands of the always-on Internet. <br>
<br>
<em>With so much going on it's kind of an overwhelming task that can be a timesuck</em><br>
<br>
It's also emotionally draining, at least in my experience.  (I don't have it in me any longer to compose two in a row.)  There's emotional labor that goes into writing/researching these FPPs.  I held off on making my first FPP because of the high standards others had set, and I did not expect how much they'd take out of me psychically.<br>
<br>
<em>I think scraping already vetted good links from the trail of a long thread is good practice for making a new thread.</em><br>
<br>
That's definitely part of my process to composing a mega-politics FPP, typically for just the past couple of days for a time frame.  (It's dismaying how the topics covered in the previous FPP are so often eclipsed by some new scandal or horrible development.)  I also review WTF Happened Today and Google News for that period, look over magazines for roundup articles, and then check my feeds for recent developments and breaking news.<br>

<em>But one idea might be to have regular Metatalk post just to crowdsource links for the next post, and communitarily decide when the new one is needed.</em><br>

This could certainly help, say, starting when the mega-thread hits 2,000 comments, with a notification that a MeTa is now open in the thread itself.  A discussion of what the framing issues are would help distribute the cognitive workload.  For instance, in this upcoming one, should we cover the looming possibility of a government shutdown and the recent attempts by Ryan and McConnell to negotiate with Trump in order to prevent it from coming to a head before the mid-terms?   Do we want to address the Javenka media push, covered in the NYT and WaPo, in the context of Jared's security clearance setbacks and Ivanka's spate of public appearances with her father at official events?  What of the recent developments about securing the mid-term elections from Russian information warfare and cyber attacks?<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/80694" target="_self">Doktor Zed</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310901" target="_self">4:10 PM</a> on July 29

<br>
<em>Pagination would lead to more chattiness</em><br>
<br>
If I'm not mistaken, the problem with chattiness was the long threads.  If the threads were shorter the chattiness wouldn't be a problem.  That lightens the mods' workload.  Pagination also saves server bandwidth, even with the Show More script, because for example I inevitably end up refreshing the whole page multiple times, usually because the page length broke things.  <br>
<br>
<em>robots</em><br>
<br>
Automation frees up our collective time that would have gone to creating hand-crafted FPPs.  Saving one or more MeFites an hour or so every week or two adds up and is that much more time available for the resistance.  If someone objects to a machine making the posts they can remember we made the machine and we can unmake it if we don't like it.  A machine is showing you these very words right now!  <br>
<br>
I could personally hand-create a new thread every night.  But if I had that responsibility, the first thing I would do is write a script running on my computer that does that for me, and it would be more reliable and higher quality.  But of course in that case I'm sure the admins would prefer do that themselves.  Either way, though, in the end product, no one would know the difference, unless they actually like the quaint phrasing or the kinds of small mistakes anyone would inevitably make.  While I understand the allure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi">Wabi-Sabi</a> in general as part of the delight of MetaFilter, I think the megathread can be a reasonable exception to that aesthetic.<br>
<br>
<em>curated FPPs</em><br>
<br>
I don't particularly need curated FPPs.  Since I read or skim every thread, I always skip the links at the top.  For people that want to catch up, each post can just be a link to the previous thread.  If people want a synopsis, the rest of the post (or one of the first comments) can be a dump of all the links from the previous thread.  If people want a curated synopsis, there are further options.  <br>
<br>
<em>also</em><br>
<br>
I have been thinking of creating a thread with chronological list of links to all the megathreads.  Where is the best place on MetaFilter for that?   Or would people prefer I do that off-site?  What do people recommend as a reasonable starting date?  Are there any resources available to help me automate the search?  Do the admins already have such a thing?<br>
<br>
This is just a first step toward a personal project finding all the external links in those threads, eliminating trivial or outdated stuff, and compiling a long list of links I can send to family members and others to convince them that (1) the treason is real and (2) the nazis are real.  large numbers of reasonable people literally do not know these things, so many of my political conversations just don't end well.  At best, they say I need to send them the links.  So I need to send them the links.<br>
<br>
So I thought if I made that list of threads I may as well put it somewhere on MetaFilter where it might help others too.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/275110" target="_self">M-x shell</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310903" target="_self">4:18 PM</a> on July 29

So if none of the ideas that anyone else thought of will work for all/any/enough/no people here, does anyone have any better ones? Because I am not married to pagination or whatever, I'm not a tech expert and I avoid Facebook and Twitter so I sure as hell can't tell what worked or didn't work there either.

Because I can accept that. It's not my decision and it's the mods' decision and we have to go with whatever they say.  I am very used to that sort of thing happening all the time.  If the mods just want to shut this down and say "This is how it is, stop asking, we are happy with how things are"  that's their prerogative.  Or if they say, want to shut down all political discussion whatsoever, that's their prerogative. I just thought we could try to think of something.<br>
<br>
But....maybe not. Oh well. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Thanks for trying!<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/37122" target="_self">jenfullmoon</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310913" target="_self">5:07 PM</a> on July 29

<a name="1310914"></a><div class="comments">I think *daily* #potus45 threads would be excellent, and have considered proposing this, so thanks.  They could morph to <em>#dailyUSpolitics</em> or <em>#dailypoliticalnewsfilter</em>.<br>
<br>
The #potus45 threads are a wealth of information and insight.  Posts on MeFi become unwieldy and impenetrable when they go over hundreds of comments, these regularly go thousands.  I understand that they require a lot of moderator time, but the more effective and accessible they are, the more ad revenue they should generate, and the better they are at being part of the site, not limited to those most devoted to them and willing to commit the time.  I would <strong>really like</strong> to be able to read them, but they are just too sprawling to come in to them in the middle, and I can't keep up.  Somebody refers to a comment, I click or scroll, get lost and sidetracked.  Daily posts would mean that people would have to be more disciplined about not re-discussing stuff.  Take it to the discussion of <em>Thing</em> on <em>Post.</em><br>
<br>
*Automated* posts, not so much.  Bad precedent, so much potential for trouble. If you asked the MeFites who are most active in those threads, who post the FPPs, to help, the posts could be daily.  Set up a location where links for the next post can be proposed, and ask those MeFites to craft the post, on a rotating basis, and be welcoming to people outside that group developing posts on their own.  Crafting good posts is a lot of work, so people who care about this should be given lots of support.  So not automated, but with a tool to facilitate posting.  Crowdsource is a useful term.  <br>
<br>
An automated post at midnight, Cortex Time, for <em>Daily Political News,</em> is not awful, but the FPP allows for the important links to be on the front page, and that's a big help.  <br>
<br>
As always, thanks to the mods who keep it running.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/12646" target="_self">theora55</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310914" target="_self">5:34 PM</a> on July 29

I think this is kind of really unfair and cruel considering how much work is involved in virtually mopping up after our textual diarrhea. <br>
<br>
I've seen mods let stuff skate by where it's like "whoa? they let that through" but the person who said it has nary said a word before. I can understand when they want to delete my nth shitty, low effort comment about whatever or sotonohito's latest screed appealed to the oppressed proletariat. Frequent posters will get nailed to the wall on edge cases because we should know better. We're typically more extreme. I don't think it's a function of some centrist cabal trying to subtly influence Metafilter, just a function of trying to let the less extreme participate even if they they're not exactly 100% in line with the letter or spirit of the rules.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/254260" target="_self">Definitely Not Sean Spicer</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310928" target="_self">7:29 PM</a> on July 29

If these threads are so necessary and live saving and valuable, they should have effort put into their creation and they shouldn't change how the site functions. I'm also opposed to planning sessions for the posts in metatalk. We already have fairly regular curse laden blowing off steam threads and everyone needs a hug threads that both seem to have drastically increased since the megathreads have become a thing. A third regularly occurring type of metatalk thread pretty much dedicated to the needs of the politics thread imo would be ridiculous and even more offputting than how much the politics threads have taken over the site. Just because some people's reasons for coming to metafilter have changed doesn't mean all of ours have and the more accommodations we make for those threads, the less the other stuff here is good.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/262202" target="_self">I'm Not Even Supposed To Be Here Today!</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310930" target="_self">7:54 PM</a> on July 29

<a name="1310940"></a><div class="comments">Pagination and other sorts of limited-context views fuck things up at a mechanical level in a variety of ways because the web, and MeFi in turn, were designed around some URL/browser structures that favor generality and compatibility over specific contextual lenses into stuff.  That's not to say it's impossible or utterly off the table—I said in another thread recently that one thing I want to put more thought into is favoring something working with a bit of compromise over something <i>not</i>-working but in an ideologically pure way—but it's not trivial.<br>
<br>
We've been playing around with a little bit of admin-side stuff using limited context views for checking flags, and it's both promising as a very context-specific admin tool where the compromises don't have a generalized effect on our experience of the site and don't require a lot of interaction with other site systems or interfaces, and sort of revealing of just how tightly that context-specific scoping needs to be to not break stuff.  We may come out of those experiments with a better idea of how to take a compromise approach on some thread view stuff to, all else aside, reduce the overall rendering cost for a page whatever else might be going on with the megathreads.  Or not.  It's experimental and early.<br>
<br>
<i>I understand that they require a lot of moderator time, but the more effective and accessible they are, the more ad revenue they should generate</i><br>
<br>
I think there's some differences in principle vs. practice there, but I agree with the general aspiration that having a thread that's more loadable and more readable in general would be a good thing and if nothing else not likely a net negative for revenue.  But.<br>
<br>
"That they require a lot of moderator time" is one of the tricky bits in practice, because making them busier and more all-consuming to manage is a resource issue.  Reworking how they're presented to effectively double the number of megathread comments per day is absolutely not costless.  Both in terms of time and in terms of emotional energy.  A MetaFilter centered around endless discussion in detail of how awful things are, scattered throughout with relitigations of every old argument and interuser sniping that needs managing if this place isn't going to just turn into a shitheap, is not the MetaFilter I was excited to come to work for a decade ago and isn't the lens through which I try to look at the site these days as I try to keep it functioning.<br>
<br>
The politics megathreads are a thing, a big thing conceptually and hard to wrestle with because as much as I personally at this point could wish them into the cornfield tomorrow and never, ever miss them, they have value to a lot of people, even people who have a hard time getting along with each other while all mutually finding that value in the threads.  So, it's complicated; I'd go as far as to say it's kinda fucked, really.  There's no obvious, clean solution to the core issues of the size and pace and regularity of these threads that doesn't involve making some <i>drastic</i> move and I don't particularly like drasticness either.  <br>
<br>
This is to some extent just venting.  I mostly keep that to more venting-centric context.  But, y'all, it's a shitty situation and we're gonna have to keep working through it and none of the "well if we just x" stuff is new or a simple clean solution; that's not to knock anyone for brainstorming but do not forget that this has been a basically full-time subject of discussion and conversation on the mod team for like two years now.  So we're not hesitant about any of these proposals out of a lack of due consideration, there's just not an easy win there.  There's a lot of people here who want a lot of different things and what would be a Fine With Me! solution for some folks would fuck up at a fundamental level other folks' expectations of how the site works and vice versa.<br>
<br>
We'll keep chewing on it and presumably continue to experiment with some changes but it's a boggy and bound-to-be-unsatisfying process by circumstantial necessity because we're solving for an entire community full of contrasting wants and needs in tension.<br>
<br>
<i>The politics threads being held hostage by a shitty clique of centrists who suck up the the mods is probably great if you are part of that clique, but for everyone else it kind of sucks.</i><br>
<br>
That's a pretty shitty comment for a whole variety of reasons.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/7418" target="_self">cortex</a> <a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/33/Who-is-in-charge-here-Are-there-admins-and-moderators-like-other-sites" class="staff" style="text-decoration:none;"><span class="staffp">(</span>staff<span class="staffp">)</span></a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310940" target="_self">8:31 PM</a> on July 29

I don't understand why those threads are tolerated in the gray.

I didn’t post this MeTa, so I didn’t “decide what we’re going to talk about” anymore than you did. Don’t be obtuse. We don’t even disagree on the merits, evidently, but it’s not shitty for me to ask fellow users to stay on topic and not derail. Again: make your own MeTa if you’ve got beef with anything off-topic in this thread.

<a name="1310980"></a><div class="comments">Also against automation and moderately against pagination, but I'd be in favor of setting a group expectation for weekly threads - say, new megathread every Monday. Or Tuesday. Typically there's some chatter in the thread, like, "Is it time for a new one? Is someone making one?" So that uncertainty leads to more commenting. But it also <em>in my opinion</em> contributes to the new-thread-hype and FPP-pressure. Like, in a classic operant conditioning kind of way. Having more regular threads, making it an unremarkable occurence, would be a good thing I think. <br>
<br>
It would also make the expectation of community labor more clear and explicit. The very idea of "automated" resets of the megathread shows how much that labor is disappeared and taken for granted.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/233817" target="_self">Rainbo Vagrant</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1310980" target="_self">12:15 AM</a> on July 30

<a name="1310985"></a><div class="comments">Look, we all know what the megathreads are. They're quarantine for politics chatfilter. They're unrewarding attentionsucks for the mods. They're haystacks where we hide the needles of periodic good, interesting, relevant comments. They're a mechanism to prevent multiple ongoing repetitious FPPs about the mad shit going down Stateside (because so much of what's going on overlaps). They're the least worst answer to a rubbish question.<br>
<br>
The individual FPPs themselves are really well put together and entail genuine effort on the part of whoever makes them, but they could almost be substituted with a script periodically posting "TRUMPSTUFF #nnn, GO! (BTW DON'T POST THESE LINKS: ....)". No-one cares about the FPP content, they either care about recent events or if you're lucky a closely-preceding link or comment. The only reason to make the least effort to facilitate ease-of-use of the megathreads is if there's a danger of people propagating /r/perpetualmegathread content more widely as a result of its inaccessibility. <br>

<a name="1310994"></a><div class="comments">I have never created a megathread FPP, nor do I intend to, because it would be a waste of my time, which, yes, is precious (and so is yours of course).  I'd just rather make my contributions in the comments.  That is not to say that I don't appreciate the amount of work that goes into them.  And some people like the recaps, so great!  It costs me nothing to skip them.  <br>
<br>
But I'm curious, for those of you who have created megathread FPPs, about how many hours of your time does it consume?  On average.  I'm guessing a good two to four hours.  That's a lot to ask of someone.  So the people who are saying, "<em>If it's time for a new megathread, make one!</em>" do not impress me, even if they themselves have done one or more.  <br>
<br>
Plus, the random aspect where it's a shared responsibility, like some kind of potluck dinner, seems very disorganized.  Even a potluck has someone who makes sure there will be each kind of food.  Here, it's supposed to just happen organically.  But only after a period of some dysfunction when the threads are useless to a sizable fraction of the community.  And hopefully multiple people don't waste their time duplicating the work.  I know if that happened to me once it would be the last time.<br>

On MetaFilter we are frequently suggesting people organize politically to achieve our goals.  Well, couldn't MetaFilter be a bit more organized?

<a name="1310996"></a><div class="comments">i have thoroughly enjoyed the evolution of this set of politics megathread. on reflection, the unifying leitmotif has been less than ideal, but keeping up to date with information (and analysis) here has been indispensable during this dark time; plus, the insights, jokes, ethical tangents, the ongoing practicum in modding, the strong sense of community, the sheer breadth of citations of and to external resources, and the frequent opportunities to reevaluate the relative merits of hillary clinton and bernie sanders as presidential candidates, have made it more enjoyable than it probably should be. <br>
<br>
i tend to blame my problems with the thread around 2000+ comments on my portable information device, rather than on the site, the thread, the community, the quality of any given comment or set thereof, or the moderators. <br>
<br>
the periodic new thread creations have been inspirational, as object-lessons in anarchic self-organizing  and as stand-alone works of top-notch FPPery. i wouldn't change it a bit. <br>

that said, i'll be here, reading for the content, regardless of any post span/frequency decisions that may be made and implemented among involved mefites. <br>

<a name="1311004"></a><div class="comments">How about doing a trial run of megathreads as a regular weekly business? Say, for the month of August?<br>
<br>
Weekends are usually a slow time for news, so new threads could go up sometime in the latter half of Sunday. We could set up a system where people sign up to make each megathread, either week by week or ahead of time for the whole month.<br>
<br>
At the end of August we could see how things went in terms of usability, mod workload, overall value, and so forth.<br>
<br>
How would people feel about something like that?  (Asks someone who's never made a megathread.

<br>
I don't think you should feel that way at all, and I'm glad you posted this. Even if nothing gets resolved (and despite the oddly personal swerve this thread took for a minute) I think it's valuable to periodically have a community check-in on how people are dealing with and using the politics mega-threads.<br>
<br>
For myself, after this discussion, I'm leaning towards less of a technical solution or a set of mod-enforced rules, but more of a slight reset of community expectations - somewhere around the 1-1.5k comment mark people should start building the next FPP (I like the idea of having a crowd-sourced MetaTalk, but if we're trying to make the mega-threads shorter, I also don't see the harm in having a few "hey, I'm working on the next one, memail me/post  some links" comments near the end) and while politics mega-threads should be more than a single link, they don't necessarily <em>need</em> to be mega-link mega- FPPs.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/145062" target="_self">soundguy99</a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1311009" target="_self">12:35 PM</a> on July 30

<br>
This is firmly where I come down. Simultaneous adjustments to how much of a post an FPP needs to be to be a good megathread post, and more people willing to make them more quickly. Put another way, I don't think people who enjoy megathreads would really be unhappy to have a new one every thousand comments as opposed to every 2500, they just scoot over to a new place and keep discussing the same general round of topics. Accordingly, these posts should be lower stakes to make (not requiring a total link round up and hours of time) and should come from within the megathread community, not from the mods or certainly not from an automated process. People who like the megathread environment should be making these posts. I'm aware that this is a topic on which reasonable people disagree but as someone who doesn't interact with the megathreads except while guest-modding (and agrees with many critiques of them but also understands why people like them) I feel like there are tweaks to the existing structure that may work.<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/user/292" target="_self">jessamyn</a> <a href="https://faq.metafilter.com/33/Who-is-in-charge-here-Are-there-admins-and-moderators-like-other-sites" class="staff retired" style="text-decoration:none;"><span class="staffp retiredp">(</span>retired<span class="staffp retiredp">)</span></a> at <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24872/Request-to-admins-to-just-have-weekly-or-even-daily-resets-of-the-megath#1311012" target="_self">1:22 PM</a> on July 30

<br>
I don't know how to fix the megathread issues.  It's hard and I step way back from that.  <br>
<br>
But, one thing that has occurred to me is that if we want to keep the FPP by humans, organically deciding to craft them, tradition alive then that might be a friction point where a bit of lubrication could be useful.  What I'm getting at is that<br>
<br>
A) I think a new megathread deserves a well crafted post to kick it off and,<br>
B) since those require work that could well be negated if someone else posts a thread and,<br>
C) we don't want to waste the time of the folks that will actually put time into crafting a new thread post to get things reset and running again, which<br>
D) is a risk if someone else is doing the same work, at the same time and beats them past the post via the Submit button.<br>
<br>
I don't think many folks would disagree with those premises. Someone mentioned using Slack to coordinate and that's laudable, perhaps even the best solution to this aside-of-a-problem.<br>
<br>
I wondered if there might not be a way for the consumers of the thread to slowly and gradually voice their support for a new thread (but not via useless comments/asides in the discussion part of things because ick, no, bad) via a voting/flagging system tweak whereby the mods or the site could display a meter or something [I told you there'd be ponies right, here's the herd coming now!] that would be a range from New to Stale or Fresh to Expired or Green to Red or whatever.  At that point folks would see the community desire for a new thread rising and could take that into account.  <br>
<br>
The bonus pony, or Bony as I so name her, would be where someone could call dibs and notify folks that they were taking it upon themselves to craft a new thread and that there'd be one up in X amount of time.<br>
<br>
As to how much this would impact the status quo of things, I don't know either, but it's a consideration anyhow.<br>
<br>
I love... well, not you all, but most of you.

<a name="1311036"></a><div class="comments">BLUF: I support the idea of experimenting next month with a new thread scheduled for Sunday afternoon/evening and starting to brainstorm suggestions the day before.   My second, but distant, choice would be a hard cutoff at 2,000 comments, perhaps with a mod heads' up at 1,500, to encourage the composition of a new megathread FPP.<br>
<br>
<em>useful information usually involves links, so it's not that hard to skim past the discussion to find, especially if the threads are smaller</em><br>
<br>
Frequently, yes, but MeFites' personal comments about how the news affects them and what they're doing about it is absolutely invaluable.  It puts the headlines into a more important context that's missing from news articles (no matter how many vox pop quotes reporters include, to say nothing of the universally unreadable comments sections).  Sources for news are plentiful on the web, but the human factor in a healthy community is not.<br>
<br>
<em>I'm in favor of keeping curated posts with links. I think they are useful now, and are going to be historically important someday. It's such a good record of what what is the news at that particular time, and what people thought was important.</em><br>
<br>
Absolutely.  In their own way, the megathread FPPs do a better job of tracking the evolution of a given story in the Trump administration than the mainstream media—which is why Team Trump keeps using the modified limited hangout tactic.  Curated links can also improve participation by presenting what the community thinks are important topics, even if it's just pinning one that we may come back to (I predict down the line, we're going to see the effects of <a href="https://www.govexec.com/management/2018/07/trump-moves-administrative-law-judge-appointments-out-of-competitive-service/149602/">Trump's decision to move hiring of administrative law judges out of competitive service</a>, for example).<br>
<br>
<em>i tend to blame my problems with the thread around 2000+ comments on my portable information device</em><br>
<br>
A quick scan of the past half-dozen megathreads suggests their file size is around 4MB, give or take, with more than 200,000 words of text.  Loading that on a portable device or smart phone is pushing past the limits of hardware (though I honestly don't understand how anyone could reasonably expect to load a megathread of even half that size on a smartphone, to each their own).<br>
<br>
<em>Weekends are usually a slow time for news, so new threads could go up sometime in the latter half of Sunday.</em><br>
<br>
This is definitely optimum.  The Friday night and Saturday night news dumps from the major papers leads to a quieter day of headlines then, and the Sunday morning shows yield soundbites rather than revelations.  (The only hitch is that @RealDonaldTrump always tries to take advantage of the lull by tweeting provocations that he hopes will dominate the news cycle on Monday.)   Even first thing on a weekday morning is a nosier time to post. <br>
<br>
<em>I don't think regular MetaTalk threads to plan the next megathread FPP are a good use of the space, but we could easily use a Slack channel (there's a MeFi politics Slack, it's pretty quiet, we could have a #ThreadIdeas) or create a Google Doc to collect some links that would form a good new thread.</em><br>
<br>
Yes, a Google Doc would be suitable for collaboration, or maybe even a scratchpad on the <a href="http://mefiwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page">MeFi Wiki</a>, if the mods are amenable.  I haven't used Slack before—I don't know if a judicious use of MeFi Chat or a Google hangout could be a substitute (introducing project management software into the mix seems a little daunting, as well as one more barrier to entry).<br>
<br>
<em>I have never created a megathread FPP, nor do I intend to, because it would be a waste of my time</em> <br>
<br>
This is classic Little Red Hen Syndrome.  It's something I'm not unfamiliar with, as it took me two years of megathreads to get off the fence and post my first one.  Part of it was anxiety about reaching the high standards set by the regulars—props to darkstar, filthy light thief, lalex, Wordshore, zachlipton, et al.—but my motivation arose from not wanting to see them burn out and stop participating.  As it turned out, composing one was less difficult than I'd imagined, but from an entirely subjective standpoint, I'd underestimated how psychologically taxing it was for me (I can't do a third in a row, sorry—two is too much for me).<br>
<br>
<em>But I'm curious, for those of you who have created megathread FPPs, about how many hours of your time does it consume? On average. I'm guessing a good two to four hours.</em><br>
<br>
Barely half that.  Funnily enough, in my own experience, it takes <em>more</em> time to compose one hurriedly, when the thread is large enough for people to complain, simply because researching under pressure is difficult and if there's a developing situation on top of that, it's all the more challenging.  If you're following the news and reading the megathread, however, you've already got a solid foundation to work from.  <br>
<br>
My own method—<em>and I'd <strong>love</strong> to hear others'</em>—is not that complicated.  It's not too different from reading the news over the course of the day, just compressed (the way an ideal megathread FPP of curated links would be).  Here's a quick-and-dirty breakdown of it in 6 Easy Steps:<blockquote>1) review the FPP of the current megathread for a sense of the issues of importance to the community and of their framing;<br>
2) re-read the back end of the current megathread to identify the breaking news/recent developments and how people are responding;<br>
3) check in with CNN and the BBC for <abbr title="In general, the mobile versions are easier for scanning. The front pages of the NYT and the Washington Post are, frankly, unhelpful, and their automated lists of top stories are worse.">headlines</abbr>—or Reuters and AFP, depending;<br>
4) scan <abbr title="I open separate tabs for each since the resultant timeline would be a mess—I have a ">my Twitter feeds</abbr>, including @ddale8, @emptywheel, @kylegriffin1, and @sarahkendzior, plus <abbr title="They tend to retweet one another—their professional circle is as incestuous as it is competitive.">an ad hoc selection of a few mainstream journalists from CNN, the NYT, the WaPo, etc.</abbr>, e.g. @KatyTurNBC and @kaitlancollins;<br>
5) once the important topics are in focus and it's time to curate links, check the past few days of <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/">What The Fuck Just Happened Today?</a> and/or <a href="https://weeklysift.com/">The Weekly Sift</a> and search Google News for particular stories; and then<br>
6) write up the FPP—by now, the post has more or less fallen into place, and the hardest part is coming up with a snappy title.</blockquote>

It would take me several times longer to research and write a comparable post for a regular FPP, even on a familiar topic.  (There's also the psychological cost that when you stare into the newsvortex, the newsvortex stares back, but that's what the Fucking Fuck threads are for.)  Brainstorming and crowdsourcing could help with the initial steps, and collaboration or rotation could help spread the workload of composing the FPP.  By comparison, I've put in at least as much time into this response as I have with any my POTUS45 FPPs.<br>
